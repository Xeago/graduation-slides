+ What issue was I to solve
+ Previous situation
+ My results
+ Things I am not satisfied with

optional: extras

# Why?

!SLIDE left reveal

### Videofyme has

+ an increasing growth of users
+ an increasing growth of videos
+ an (until recently) crippled database

!SLIDE

# Search
## for videos

!SLIDE left reveal

### How was this done before?

1. Transform the query into a regex
2. Tokenize several columns of the video
3. Apply the regex on each tokenized string
4. Collect the results

!SLIDE

# Happy?

!SLIDE

## No!

### &nbsp;

!SLIDE

## No!

### Slow as a snail.

## PROS

+ Easy to implement
+ Fuzzy regexes are better than  
    SQL's `LIKE "%mytoken"`

!SLIDE left

##CONS

+ Not scalable
+ Not flexible
+ Hard to maintain
+ No unicode support (lack of ICU)

!SLIDE
# &nbsp;
Two kinds of search

!SLIDE

### Non-fulltext search

Tagging

Classification

!NOTES
Tagging: associating keywords to a document
Cliassification: categories and subcategories

!SLIDE

### Full-text search
Searching documents in a database, using free text.

!SLIDE

#Elasticsearch

!SLIDE left

### What is Elasticsearch?
+ Lucene based full text search
+ NoSQL key-value store
+ Schema free, document oriented
+ Out of the box scaling and failover
+ Not just for search: analytics

and more!

!SLIDE left

### So Elasticsearch gives
+ Powerfull full text search  
    with an expressive query language  
     (near real time: < 1 second)
+ Distributed by design
+ Fault tolerant
+ Easy sharding
+ Start small, scale massively!

!SLIDE

# Cool!
### But is it actually true?

!SLIDE

# Yes
### but it still requires
### common sense

!SLIDE
!SLIDE
###So…

!SLIDE
### I read and studied

!SLIDE left reveal list-style-none

+ followed mailing lists
+ collaborated on IRC
+ implemented a very  
    basic search system  
    to get familiar with  
    VideofyMe's API

###Example of analyzers

Searching for colors

Autocompletion

### What happens when...
+ The ideal user types "violet red"
+ The average user types "viollette red"
+ The random user types "bloo ret"

### Autocomplete analyzer

1. Input
    + "Édith Piaf"
1. Standard tokenizer
    + ["Édith", "Piaf"]
2. Lowercase token filter
    + ["édith", "Piaf"]
3. Ascii-folding token filter (using ICU)
    + ["eidth", "piaf"]
4. edge-ngrams token filter
    + ["e","ed","edi","edit","edith",  
    "p","pi","pia","piaf"]

### Things I am not satisfied with

&nbsp;

+ Lack of formal documents  
    *Advised against by Patrick*
+ Lack of full deployment  
    *Prevented by AWS*
